In this respository you will find a 'Matlab.pdf' presentation file. Consider this as your learning base.
You will find .m (Matlab Script) files herein the respository sorted by alphabetical order. You will download these script files and store it in your matlab work directory.
Upon going through the slides on the Matlab.pdf you should open the associated .m files.
Within the .m files there are several code parts some are commented while rests are ready for execution.
You should uncomment the ommited section after the initial running the initially active section, and then by commenting the active part.
In this way you will be able to perceive all the required concepts regarding the associated topics of the sildes.

Wish you have a happy journey.
